            <h2>Grub Guru</h2>
            <h3>INTRO</h3>
            <p>In this semester long project, I designed a food management app to solve unhealthy eating habits for college students.
                <br><br>
                My goal is for users to efficiently keep track of what food they have and need, form healthy eating habits like eating a balanced diet, easily set up meal plans and prep for the week, and discover simple recipes based on what they like. 
            </p>

            <h3>USER STORY 01</h3>
            <h1>Rosemary</h1>
            <p>As a very busy college student, Rosemary wants to incorporate an organized, balanced diet into her routine so that she can start healthy eating habits, discover easy recipes, and keep a grocery list that makes shopping for food easy.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>INTERACTION ARCHITECTURE</h3>
            <p>Rosemary can hardly keep up with her schedule, and incorporating eating into it seems impossible. She opens the app to solve her problem of unorganized eating habits. Her onboarding info will be used to generate meal plans to fit her needs and set reminders so she doesn't forget.

            <h3>FLOW 01</h3>
            <p>The first flow follows Rosemary's onboarding process. Although it is somewhat lengthy, it will allow for the app to be catered to her and reduces the amount of work required down the line.</p>

            <h3>USER STORY 02</h3>
            <h1>Brie</h1>
            <p>As a student in the arts, Brie spends a lot of time focusing on her craft, and although she makes an effort to eat healthy and cook her meals, she would like an easier way to keep track so that the process is less stressful.</p>

            <h3>INTERACTION ARCHITECTURE</h3>
            <p>Brie knows the importance of healthy eating habits, but maintaining them only adds to her stress as a student. With the app, she can create a meal plan and grocery list with the push of a button. 

                    This will help her not worry about shopping trips or having meals planned to eat- everything is already planned for her.</p>

                <h1>Chip</h1>
                <p>As a student who is on campus often, with little time to make food during the day, Chip wants an approachable and quick way to prepare his meals so that he can minimize unhealthy meals and maintain focus on his school work. </p>

                <h3>INTERACTION ARCHITECTURE</h3>
                <p>Chip is rarely home during the day, so he needs to prepare lunches in advance for the week with the meal prep feature. He receives a notification to meal prep at his selected time, and he is walked through the selected recipe.

                        This will help him ensure he has a meal to eat while he isnâ€™t home.</p>
