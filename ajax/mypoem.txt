<p id="verse1">Call the roller of big cigars,<br>
The muscular one, and bid him whip<br>
In kitchen cups concupiscent curds.</p>

<p id="verse2">Let the wenches dawdle in such dress<br>
As they are used to wear, and let the boys<br>
Bring flowers in last month's newspapers.</p>

<p id="verse3">Let be be finale of seem.<br>
The only emperor is the emperor of ice-cream.</p>

<p id="verse4">Take from the dresser of deal,<br>
Lacking the three glass knobs, that sheet<br>
On which she embroidered fantails once<br>
And spread it so as to cover her face.</p>

<p id="verse5">If her horny feet protrude, they come<br>
To show how cold she is, and dumb.</p>

<p id="verse6">Let the lamp affix its beam.<br>
The only emperor is the emperor of ice-cream.</p>
